00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.382
Finding where to store,

00:00:01.617 --> 00:00:04.164
...share and use your
data in such a way...

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:06.305
...that it's accessible from
anywhere, is hard.

00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:08.237
And when teamwork is involved,

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:09.395
...it gets even harder.

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:11.012
What are your options?

00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:13.488
You can send files
as e-mail attachments,

00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:16.196
...but can't upload
more than 25 megabytes.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.801
You can set up an FTP server,

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.363
...having to download and upload...

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:22.387
...everytime a file is changed.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.477
You can use an
external hard drive,

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:26.605
...along with the danger
of losing your files...

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:27.353
...if it fails.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.197
Wish there was an
easier and safer way?

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.079
Now there's.

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:32.312
With Dropbox...

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:34.724
...you can access your
files from anywhere.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:36.442
You've got a lot of storage...

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:37.700
...for all of your files,

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:39.668
shared folders and documents...

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:41.895
...file versioning and recovery,

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:43.147
...and lots more...

00:00:43.568 --> 00:00:45.076
...all in a secured environment.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.359
Just drag and Dropbox.
